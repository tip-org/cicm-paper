\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
There has recently been increased interest in inductive theorem
proving, both in special-purpose provers such as
IsaPlanner, Zeno and HipSpec, and in SMT-solvers and first-order provers such as
CVC4 and SPASS. To ease evaluation and comparison between systems,
good benchmarks are important. However, there has not been a shared
standard benchmark suite for inductive theorem provers. This paper
describes initial efforts to collect benchmarks for inductive theorem
provers which can be shared among developers and users. 
We expect this benchmark suite to continuously grow as
more problems are submitted by the community. New challenge problems
will promote new developments of provers which will greatly benefit
both developers and users of inductive theorem provers. 

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

goal: a format with explicit function definitions (hipspec, zeno, isaplanner, acl2, dafny),
      but also usable for provers that are not oriented towards functional programs (cvc4, new spass)
      (but still use explicit datatype definitions (?)).

%\section{The TIP language/format}
%
%based on SMT-LIB
%  differences:
%    recursive define-fun (note: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7740556/equivalent-of-define-fun-in-z3-api#7745041)
%    polymorphism
%    match-expression
%    + prove top level statement
%    + define-datatype instead of define-datatypes
%         (due to mutually recursive datatypes might differ in kind because of polymorphism)
%  advantages:
%    can import well defined theories from SMTLIB, such as linear arithmetic
%    easy to parse
%
%bnf + example


\section{The benchmarks}

The benchmarks are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/tip-org/benchmarks}. 

Benchmarks are written in a subset of the WhyML language, with the recent extension to support higher-order functions.

Which tools/translationgs are available for WhyML?

How to contribute benchmarks?

from the hipspec-cade paper. two testsuites: overlap?

+ our own examples

+ koen's new examples

all functions in the benchmarks terminate. the format does not presuppose this

%\section{Tools}
%
%done: ghc frontend (subset of Haskell). example
%
%done: lambda lifting...
%
%could be done before deadline: parser. tip -> smtlib.
%
%before camera ready deadline (work in progress): monomorphiser, tip -> other formats

\section{Conclusion and Further Work}
- Tools for conversion to other formats

- Solicit submissions of additional benchmarks and challenge problems.
